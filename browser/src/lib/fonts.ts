// Which font libass needs for a given piece of subtitle text.
//
// In a browser, libass has no system fonts: whatever it is handed is all it
// has. JASSUB bundles Liberation Sans, which covers Latin, Greek, Cyrillic
// and Hebrew — so Russian and Ukrainian are fine out of the box, and
// Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Hindi and Thai render as rows of tofu
// boxes. Silently: libass logs a fontselect miss, draws the boxes, and
// nothing throws. The `.srt` export looks perfect the whole time, because
// that is plain text and never goes near a font.
//
// So each non-Latin script we offer as a translation target gets a font,
// and it is fetched **only when the text actually needs it**. A user
// subtitling in English never downloads the 2 MB of Chinese and Japanese.
